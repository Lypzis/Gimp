- Binary Choices

* Looks real, or is iconised
* 3D or 2D in appearance
* Transparency- are parts of image see through?
* Shading- glat shading through to 'realistic'
* Square Edged, rounded square, circular etc.
* Axis of Symmetry / Mirroing

- Breaking your rules

* Rules are meant to be broken?
* Break little things whilst keeping to the idea of the rule
* Slipping too far from your specification will lead to inconsistency
* Consistency is important with a collection!

- My specification:

* iconised.
* 2D.
* No transparency.
* Shading- flat shading.
* Circular.
* No axis of Symmetry.
